# Project 1 - NBA Fandom



## Overview

For Project 1, we decided to create a NBA Fandom Page, where you can easily see the stats related to your favorite teams and players as well as the upcoming games for the week. In order to do this, we used several different API libraries. Please see the Credits for the full list.
